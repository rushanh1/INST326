AI Jornal
This week I was able to get my hands on a usable AI tool, something similiar to 
Gemini.
Profesor Dempwolf introduced us to Gemini and encouraged us to us this AI journal throughout the course. Not as a cheating
tool but as a daily tracker.
After the final line was typed, debugging began for ## Exercise 11: Basic Price Math.
Exercise 15 took me hook, I asked AI to help me understand "first_dot" and last_dot"
what
next
is if finally working?
I think thats a yes
On to the next exercise, which is exercise 2.
Whats the exercise
Exercise week 2 and 3 proved to be a review of what was previously taught in the introduction to Python.
I was having trouble with number 15 as the "[]" signs kept appreaing in the print screen and I was trying to remove it
but removing it would cause the code not to run and get an error screen. Help was needed for this.
I tried using AI for assitance but I my inturpretation was misunderstood and AI ignored my command/clearification and 
printed out the code as before with no changes and the "[]" still printing at the end. Here is the code as typed 
titles = ["Artificial Intelligence", "AI Basics", "Data Science 101", "Ethics in Technology", "Human-Centered AI"]

# First three titles
print(titles[0:3])
"Write a function `find_book_index(titles, search_title)` that returns the **index** of the first exact match, or `-1` if not found."
Was proven to be difficult because I didnt have a print command, but included it in my "hello_world.py" file.
Needed help with the "Classes" part of the exercise. Asked a group member and was able to find a solution.
Started working on the group project or assignments this week as well.
Another attempt at exercise 5
Another attempt exercise, which is number 6.
