AI Jornal
This week I was able to get my hands on a usable AI tool, something similiar to 
Gemini.
Profesor Dempwolf introduced us to Gemini and encouraged us to us this AI journal throughout the course. Not as a cheating
tool but as a daily tracker.
After the final line was typed, debugging began for ## Exercise 11: Basic Price Math.
Exercise 15 took me hook, I asked AI to help me understand "first_dot" and last_dot"
what
next
is if finally working?
